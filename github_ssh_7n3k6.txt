Once you have an account on github, every time you access the remote
repository (using "clone", "pull", "fetch" or "push" git command), git will
ask you to supply username and password (like I did when I did the hands-on).
If this is fine with you, NO OTHER SETUP IS NEEDED OTHER THAN HAVING A SSH
CLIENT RUNNING ON YOUR SYSTEM (which is always installed by default).

If you do not want to supply username and password every time you access
the github remote repository for "push" and "pull", you can setup ssh keys.
The procedure is outlined in:
